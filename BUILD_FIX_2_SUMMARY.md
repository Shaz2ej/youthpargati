# Build Error Fix Summary #2

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the second build failure related to the missing `getCoursesByPackageId` export.

## Issue
The build was failing because PackageCourses.jsx was trying to import `getCoursesByPackageId` from src/lib/api.js, but this function was not exported from the api.js file.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated api.js
- Added the missing `getCoursesByPackageId` function
- Properly exported the function so it can be imported by other components
- The function fetches courses based on package ID from the Supabase database
- Added proper error handling and logging

## Files Modified
- src/lib/api.js

## Function Details
The `getCoursesByPackageId` function:
- Takes a packageId parameter
- Queries the Supabase database for courses associated with that package ID
- Returns the data and any error that might occur
- Follows the same pattern as other functions in the file

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
- The function is properly exported and can be imported
- No more import errors in PackageCourses.jsx
- Build completes successfully
- The function correctly fetches courses by package ID
- Error handling works properly

## Additional Notes
This fix resolves the specific build error mentioned in the Netlify build logs. The function now properly integrates with the existing codebase and follows the established patterns for API functions in this project.
