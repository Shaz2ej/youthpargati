# Build Error Fix Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the build failure caused by the import error in Register.jsx.

## Issue
The build was failing because Register.jsx was trying to import `auth` from src/firebase.js, but the `auth` export was removed during the migration from Firebase to Supabase authentication.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Register.jsx
- Changed import from `{ auth }` to `{ supabase }` from '@/firebase.js'
- Replaced Firebase authentication methods with Supabase equivalents:
  - `createUserWithEmailAndPassword(auth, email, password)` → `supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password })`
  - `updateProfile(cred.user, { displayName: form.name })` → Handled through Supabase user metadata
  - Firebase error codes handling → Supabase error message handling

### 2. Updated firebase.js
- Added backward compatibility `auth` object with mock functions to prevent build errors:
  - `createUserWithEmailAndPassword`
  - `updateProfile`
  - `signInWithEmailAndPassword`
  - `signOut`
- These mock functions wrap Supabase authentication methods

## Files Modified
- src/pages/Register.jsx
- src/firebase.js

## Testing
The changes have been tested to ensure:
- Register page works with Supabase authentication
- No more import errors
- Build completes successfully
- User registration flow works correctly
- Error handling is properly implemented

## Additional Notes
The backward compatibility layer in firebase.js ensures that any other components that might still be using Firebase-like API calls will not break, while allowing us to gradually migrate to the full Supabase authentication system.
