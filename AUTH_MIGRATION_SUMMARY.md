# Authentication Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to migrate from Firebase ID Token authentication to direct Supabase Google OAuth.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `src/firebase.js`
- Removed Firebase dependencies
- Implemented direct Supabase Google OAuth
- Added `signInWithGoogle` function that calls `supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({ provider: 'google' })`
- Added `signOut` function for user logout

### 2. Updated `src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- Replaced Firebase authentication with Supabase authentication
- Updated to use `supabase.auth.getSession()` and `supabase.auth.onAuthStateChange()`
- Removed Firebase-specific imports and logic

### 3. Created `src/pages/CompleteProfile.jsx`
- New page for users to enter mobile number and state
- Form with validation and error handling
- Redirects to dashboard after successful submission

### 4. Updated `src/App.jsx`
- Added route for `/complete-profile` page
- Protected the new route with `ProtectedRoute`

### 5. Updated `src/pages/StudentDashboard.jsx`
- Added logic to check if user has completed profile
- Redirects to `/complete-profile` if mobile number is missing
- Updated user data fetching to work with Supabase user object

### 6. Updated `src/pages/Login.jsx`
- Added Google Sign-In button
- Implemented `handleGoogleSignIn` function that calls the new Supabase OAuth function
- Disabled email/password login (can be re-enabled if needed)

### 7. Updated `src/pages/PaymentSuccess.jsx`
- Removed Firebase ID token logic
- Simplified authentication flow to work with Supabase session

### 8. Updated `src/lib/api.js`
- Renamed `getStudentIdByFirebaseUid` to `getStudentIdBySupabaseUid`
- Updated all functions to work with Supabase user IDs
- Fixed syntax error in `getUserReferralCodes` function

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Direct Supabase Google OAuth**: Users can now sign in directly with Google through Supabase
2. **Profile Completion Check**: Users are redirected to complete their profile if mobile number is missing
3. **Seamless Authentication Flow**: Authentication state is properly managed throughout the application
4. **Clean Redirects**: Users are redirected appropriately based on their authentication and profile status

## How It Works

1. User clicks "Sign in with Google" on the login page
2. Supabase OAuth flow is initiated
3. After successful authentication, user is redirected to the dashboard
4. Dashboard checks if user has completed their profile (mobile number present)
5. If profile is incomplete, user is redirected to `/complete-profile`
6. After completing profile, user is redirected to the dashboard
7. If profile is complete, user stays on the dashboard

## Testing

All changes have been tested to ensure:
- Google Sign-In works correctly
- Profile completion flow works as expected
- Redirects happen correctly based on user state
- Data is properly saved to Supabase
- Error handling works properly
